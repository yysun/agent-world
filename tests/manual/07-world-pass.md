- Use the playwright tool to navigate to http://localhost:8080/World/Test%20World
- Create a new chat
- Send a message: <world>pass</world>
- Expected result: The world stops without agent replies. The chat UI shows the conversation returning control to the human.

Notes:
- Ensure the web server is running and you have the Test World roster visible before starting.
