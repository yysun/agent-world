- Use the playwright tool to navigate to http://localhost:8080/World/Test%20World
- Create a new chat
- Send a message: Great work so far—let's loop in @a3 later.
- Expected result: No agent responds immediately. The mid-sentence mention is stored in memory for later retrieval instead of triggering a reply.

Notes:
- Ensure the web server is running and you have the Test World roster visible before starting.
