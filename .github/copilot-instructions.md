## File Comment Blocks
- Add/update comment blocks at the top of each source file summarizing features, logic, and changes
- Create before editing if missing; update after changes
- Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness

## Command Keywords
- **AA**: Create plan with check boxes → save checklist to `docs/plan/`
- **AS**: Execute plan → implement step-by-step, mark done, git stage with messages
- **CC**: Present options → wait for confirmation before proceeding  
- **DD**: Update file comment block → remove redundancy, ensure accuracy
- **SS**: Step-by-step with approval → implement from plan, wait for confirmation each step
- **GG**: Document features → create/update markdown in `docs/` (use mermaid if needed)

## Planning Rules
- Large changes or "AA" → always create plan first, get confirmation
- Focus on functionality/logic, not optimizations
- Break into smaller, actionable steps with context/dependencies
