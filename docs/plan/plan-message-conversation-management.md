# Message Privacy and Conversation Management - Implementation Plan

## Overview
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Intelligent conversation management system that enables natural agent interactions while preventing chaos, maintaining privacy, and ensuring human oversight remains accessible.

## âœ… Phase 1: Agent-Level Enhancements (COMPLETED)

### âœ… Step 1: Enhanced Message Filtering Logic
**File**: `src/agent.ts` - `shouldRespondToMessage()` function
**Goal**: Improve agent message filtering with better @mention detection and rules

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] **1.1** Update @mention parsing to support agent names only (not IDs)
  - âœ… Extract agent names from `@agentName` pattern with robust regex
  - âœ… Support case-insensitive matching (@Alice, @alice)
  - âœ… Ignore malformed mentions (@@agent, @nonexistent, @) using negative lookbehind
- [x] **1.2** Enhance message response rules
  - âœ… Public messages (no @mentions): All agents respond to human messages only
  - âœ… Private messages (with @mentions): Only mentioned agents respond
  - âœ… Agent-to-agent messages: Only respond if explicitly mentioned
  - âœ… Self-message prevention: Never respond to own messages
- [x] **1.3** Add validation for agent existence
  - âœ… @mention parsing extracts valid agent names
  - âœ… Invalid mentions treated as public messages

### âœ… Step 2: Turn Counter Implementation
**File**: `src/world.ts` - Add global conversation tracking
**Goal**: Prevent infinite agent-to-agent conversations

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] **2.1** Add turn counter storage
  - âœ… Created `worldConversationCounters` Map<worldName, number>
  - âœ… Track consecutive agent messages per world
  - âœ… Initialize counter to 0 when world is created/loaded
- [x] **2.2** Implement counter increment logic
  - âœ… Increment counter when agent publishes message
  - âœ… Reset counter to 0 on human or system messages
  - âœ… Added counter tracking in `subscribeAgentToMessages()` function
- [x] **2.3** Add turn limit enforcement
  - âœ… Check counter before allowing agent response
  - âœ… Block agent processing when counter >= 20
  - âœ… Inject @human redirect message when limit reached

### âœ… Step 3: Pass Command Processing
**File**: `src/agent.ts` - `processAgentMessage()` function
**Goal**: Allow agents to explicitly hand control to humans

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] **3.1** Add pass command detection
  - âœ… Scan agent response for `<world>pass</world>` pattern
  - âœ… Use regex to detect command anywhere in response content
- [x] **3.2** Implement pass command behavior
  - âœ… Replace agent response with "@human [AgentName] is passing control to you"
  - âœ… Reset turn counter to 0 when pass command is detected
  - âœ… Prevent normal agent response when pass command is found

### âœ… Step 4: Auto-Mention Addition
**File**: `src/agent.ts` - Response generation logic
**Goal**: Automatically add @mentions when agents reply to other agents

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] **4.1** Detect agent-to-agent conversations
  - âœ… Identify when agent is responding to another agent's message
  - âœ… Extract original sender from message metadata
- [x] **4.2** Auto-add @mention to responses
  - âœ… Prepend "@[senderName] " to agent response when replying to another agent
  - âœ… Skip auto-mention for human messages (already have natural addressing)
  - âœ… Ensure no duplicate @mentions if agent already included them

### âœ… Step 5: Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
**File**: `src/agent.ts`, `src/world.ts` - Add conversation tracking logs
**Goal**: Provide visibility into conversation management behavior

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] **5.1** Add turn counter logging
  - âœ… Log when counter increments/resets
  - âœ… Log when turn limit is reached
  - âœ… Log pass command detections
- [x] **5.2** Add @mention processing logs
  - âœ… Log mention extraction and validation
  - âœ… Log routing decisions (public vs private)
  - âœ… Log auto-mention additions

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Event Bus Selective Routing (Future Enhancement)

### Step 6: Event Bus Gate Function
**File**: `src/event-bus.ts` - Add selective routing for messages topic
**Goal**: Route messages only to relevant agents for performance optimization

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **6.1** Create message analysis function
  - Extract @mentions from message content
  - Validate mentioned agents exist in world
  - Classify message as public (no mentions) or private (with mentions)
- [ ] **6.2** Implement selective routing logic
  - Public messages: Route to all agents in world
  - Private messages: Route only to mentioned agents
  - Apply only to 'messages' topic, leave 'world' and 'sse' unchanged
- [ ] **6.3** Update agent subscription logic
  - Agents receive only relevant messages
  - Simplify agent filtering (no need to check mentions)
  - Maintain self-message prevention

## Testing Strategy

### âœ… Unit Tests (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Test @mention parsing** - âœ… Various mention formats and edge cases implemented
- [x] **Test turn counter logic** - âœ… Increment, reset, limit enforcement tested
- [x] **Test pass command detection** - âœ… Various content formats covered
- [x] **Test auto-mention addition** - âœ… Agent-to-agent vs agent-to-human scenarios

### âœ… Integration Tests (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Test full conversation flows** - âœ… Multi-agent conversations with limits implemented
- [x] **Test human intervention** - âœ… Recovery from turn limits and pass commands working
- [x] **Test privacy behavior** - âœ… Public vs private message routing tested

### âœ… End-to-End Tests (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Test CLI conversation flow** - âœ… Human â†’ Agent â†’ Agent â†’ Human flows working
- [x] **Test limit enforcement** - âœ… 20-message limit with automatic intervention active
- [x] **Test pass command flow** - âœ… Agent passes control, human regains control functioning

## âœ… Implementation Results

### Current Status: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
- **All 129 tests passing** across 9 test suites
- **5/5 conversation management tests passing**
- **Turn limit enforcement working** (logs show counter reaching 20 and triggering limit)
- **@mention system fully functional** with malformed mention handling
- **Pass command working** with dynamic imports and proper error handling
- **Auto-mention addition active** for agent-to-agent responses
- **Comprehensive logging implemented** for debugging and monitoring

### Key Features Working:
1. **@Mention System**: `@agentName` with case-insensitive matching, malformed mention rejection
2. **Turn Counter**: Tracks consecutive agent messages, resets on human/system input, blocks at limit 20
3. **Pass Command**: `<world>pass</world>` allows agents to hand control back to humans
4. **Auto-Mention**: Agents automatically add @mentions when responding to other agents
5. **Message Privacy**: Agents only respond to public human messages or when directly mentioned
6. **Enhanced Logging**: Full visibility into mention detection, routing decisions, turn counting

## Data Structures

### Turn Counter Storage
```typescript
// In src/world.ts
const worldConversationCounters = new Map<string, number>();

interface ConversationState {
  consecutiveAgentMessages: number;
  lastMessageSender: string;
  lastMessageTimestamp: string;
}
```

### Enhanced Message Data
```typescript
// In src/types.ts
interface MessageAnalysis {
  mentions: string[];
  isPublic: boolean;
  isPrivate: boolean;
  validMentions: string[];
  invalidMentions: string[];
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- All changes are additive to existing functionality
- Feature flags can disable new behavior if issues arise
- Original message broadcasting remains as fallback

### Performance Considerations
- Turn counter stored in memory (low overhead)
- @mention parsing uses simple regex (fast)
- Phase 1 maintains current event broadcasting (no routing changes)

### Compatibility
- Existing agent configurations unchanged
- Current CLI behavior preserved
- All existing tests should continue passing

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Metrics
1. **Turn Limiting**: No more than 20 consecutive agent messages in any conversation
2. **Pass Commands**: Agents can successfully hand control to humans
3. **@Mention Detection**: Agents respond only when mentioned (private messages)
4. **Auto-Mention Addition**: Agent responses include @mentions when replying to other agents
5. **Human Control**: Humans can always regain conversation control

### Phase 2 Success Metrics
1. **Selective Routing**: Private messages reach only mentioned agents
2. **Performance**: Reduced message processing overhead for large agent pools
3. **Privacy**: Private conversations remain isolated from other agents
