# First Mention Only - Implementation Plan

## Overview
✅ **REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS COMPLETE** - Implement first-mention-only response logic to prevent multiple agents responding to the same message.

## Implementation Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Requirements Analysis (COMPLETED)
- [x] **1.1** Document current behavior and desired behavior
- [x] **1.2** Define mention priority rules (first mention only)  
- [x] **1.3** Specify edge cases and message type handling
- [x] **1.4** Create success criteria and testing requirements

### 🔧 Step 2: Update Mention Detection Logic
**File**: `src/agent.ts` - `extractMentions()` function
**Goal**: Return only the first valid mention instead of all mentions

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **2.1** Modify `extractMentions()` function behavior
  - Return first valid mention only instead of array of all mentions
  - Skip malformed mentions when finding first valid mention
  - Maintain case-insensitive matching
  - Return empty array if no valid mentions found
- [ ] **2.2** Update function signature and return type
  - Consider renaming to `extractFirstMention()` for clarity
  - Update return type to `string[]` with max length 1
  - Maintain backward compatibility for debug logging
- [ ] **2.3** Update debug logging messages
  - Change from "Found mentions: [a1, a2]" to "First mention: a1" 
  - Add detection when multiple mentions exist but only first used
  - Log when malformed mentions are skipped

### 🔧 Step 3: Update Message Response Logic  
**File**: `src/agent.ts` - `shouldRespondToMessage()` function
**Goal**: Use first mention only for response decisions

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **3.1** Update mention checking logic
  - Change from `mentions.includes(agentName)` to first-mention comparison
  - Ensure only first mentioned agent responds to human messages
  - Maintain existing logic for agent-to-agent messages
- [ ] **3.2** Update debug logging for routing decisions
  - Log which agent is the first mention target
  - Log when agent is not first mention (won't respond)
  - Maintain existing public/private message classification
- [ ] **3.3** Edge case handling
  - Handle empty mentions array (public message)
  - Handle agent mentioning self first (skip to next valid mention)
  - Maintain system message behavior (all agents respond)

### 🧪 Step 4: Update Tests
**Files**: `tests/agent-message-process.test.ts`, `tests/conversation-management.test.ts`
**Goal**: Validate first-mention-only behavior

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **4.1** Update existing mention detection tests
  - Test first mention extraction with multiple mentions
  - Test malformed mention handling in first position
  - Test edge cases (empty, self-mention, etc.)
- [ ] **4.2** Add new multi-agent response tests
  - Test "hi @a1 say hi to @a2" → only a1 responds
  - Test "@invalid @a2 hello" → only a2 responds
  - Test public messages still work for all agents
- [ ] **4.3** Update conversation management tests
  - Verify turn counter only increments for first mentioned agent
  - Verify auto-mention logic works with first-mention-only
  - Test pass command behavior with multiple mentions

### 🔍 Step 5: Integration Testing
**Goal**: Ensure system-wide behavior is correct

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **5.1** CLI integration testing
  - Test multi-agent scenarios through CLI interface
  - Verify only first mentioned agent appears in streaming responses
  - Test turn limit enforcement with first-mention-only
- [ ] **5.2** Event system integration
  - Verify event publishing happens only once per first mentioned agent
  - Test SSE streaming shows only first mentioned agent response
  - Verify debug events show correct first-mention detection
- [ ] **5.3** Memory and persistence testing
  - Verify only first mentioned agent saves conversation to memory
  - Test agent conversation history remains accurate
  - Verify system message behavior unchanged

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Function Signatures
```typescript
// Before: Returns all mentions
function extractMentions(content: string): string[]

// After: Returns first mention only (max length 1)  
function extractMentions(content: string): string[]
// OR rename to:
function extractFirstMention(content: string): string | null
```

### Updated Logic Flow
```typescript
// Before: Check if agent name in any mention
const shouldRespond = mentions.includes(agentName);

// After: Check if agent is first mention
const shouldRespond = mentions.length > 0 && mentions[0] === agentName;
```

### Debug Message Examples
```typescript
// Before: "[Mention Detection] Found mentions: [a1, a2]"
// After: "[Mention Detection] First mention: a1 (skipped: a2)"

// Before: "[Message Routing] Private message - a2 will respond"  
// After: "[Message Routing] Private message - a2 will not respond (not first mention)"
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes
- Logic changes are contained to mention detection functions
- Existing public message behavior (no mentions) unchanged
- System message behavior (all agents respond) unchanged
- Event publishing and memory persistence logic unchanged

### Medium Risk Areas
- Multi-agent conversation flows may change behavior
- Existing tests may expect multiple agent responses
- CLI display might show different agent interaction patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive test coverage before deployment
- Add feature flag capability for rollback if needed
- Update documentation with new behavior examples
- Validate all existing test scenarios still work appropriately

## Success Metrics

### Functional Validation
1. **Single Response**: "hi @a1 say hi to @a2" produces only one agent response (a1)
2. **Public Messages**: "hello everyone" still triggers all agents
3. **First Valid**: "@invalid @a2 hello" triggers only a2 response
4. **Turn Counter**: Increment only happens once per message
5. **Memory**: Only responding agent saves conversation to memory

### Performance Validation  
1. **Response Time**: No degradation in agent response latency
2. **Event Load**: Reduced event processing (fewer agents responding)
3. **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory saves per message

### Regression Validation
1. **Test Suite**: All 129+ existing tests continue to pass
2. **CLI Interface**: All existing CLI commands work unchanged
3. **Event System**: All event types continue functioning correctly
