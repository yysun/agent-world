# World-Agent Relationship Implementation Plan

## Overview
Ensure agents of a world are created and loaded correctly in the one-to-many relationship between World and Agents. This plan focuses on functionality and logic, not optimizations.

**SCOPE**: This implementation focuses exclusively on the `core/` folder (new manager modules) and will not modify the legacy `src/` system.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation (Core System Only)
- **World Management**: `core/world-manager.ts` handles world CRUD operations
- **Agent Management**: `core/agent-manager.ts` handles agent CRUD operations  
- **Storage**: `core/world-storage.ts` and `core/agent-storage.ts` for file persistence
- **Event Systems**: `core/agent-events.ts` for agent event handling
- **Types**: `core/types.ts` defines Agent, World, and related interfaces

### Key Issues Identified (Core System)
1. **Agent-World Loading**: Agents need proper loading into world.agents Map
2. **Event Subscription**: Agents may not be properly subscribed to world events
3. **Memory Management**: Agent memory structure needs validation and consistency
4. **Data Integrity**: No validation of world-agent relationships in core system
5. **Runtime State**: EventEmitter and agents Map reconstruction needs verification
