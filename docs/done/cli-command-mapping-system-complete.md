# CLI Command Mapping System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a direct command mapping system in the CLI to enhance command processing efficiency and create a clearer separation between commands and messages.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Direct Command Mapping
- Created a command mapping system where `/command` directly maps to the corresponding command type
- Implemented enhanced command parsing with command type detection
- Added support for command aliases

### 2. Command Processing Updates
- Updated `processCLIInput` to distinguish between commands and messages
- Implemented direct command execution for inputs starting with `/`
- Enhanced error handling for invalid commands
- Added command type detection for better routing

### 3. Message Handling
- Implemented direct message publishing for non-command inputs
- Simplified the message flow by bypassing system events
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing CLI functionality

### 4. Integration Testing
- Created integration test for CLI command mapping verification
- Tested commands with and without parameters
- Verified proper error handling for invalid commands
- Confirmed proper message handling

## Implementation Details

### Command Mapping
```typescript
// Command mapping object - maps CLI command names to internal command types
const COMMAND_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
  'clear': 'clearAgentMemory',
  'world': 'getWorld',
  'worlds': 'getWorlds',
  // Additional commands...
};
```

### Enhanced Command Parsing
```typescript
export function parseCLICommand(input: string): {
  command: string;
  args: string[];
  commandType: string; // Added for direct mapping
  isValid: boolean;
  error?: string;
} {
  // Implementation that extracts command name and maps to command type
}
```

### Direct Message Handling
```typescript
// Send message directly to message event (not through system event)
publishMessage(world, input, sender);
```

## Benefits Achieved
1. Cleaner separation between command and message handling
2. More efficient command execution path by bypassing system events
3. Improved error handling with specific command validation
4. Better code organization with clearer separation of concerns
5. Enhanced maintainability with more structured command processing

## Next Steps
1. Update other parts of the typed command system as outlined in the main plan
2. Consider adding command aliases for common operations
3. Enhance parameter validation for specific command types
