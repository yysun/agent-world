# Say Hello to **Agent World** üåçü§ñ

*The first zero-code playground where AI agents talk, cooperate, and get real work done‚Äîpowered only by plain-language prompts.*

## Why Agents Matter

AI agents promise to behave like tireless co-workers: triaging tickets, scaling servers, or even hosting an RPG campaign. Yet the road from idea to working prototype is still strewn with hurdles.

## üò£ The Big Headaches‚ÄîA Real‚ÄêWorld Walk-Through

| Framework                         | What you actually do, step-by-step                                                                                                                                                     | Hidden Cost                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI Assistants / Agent SDK** | Create venv ‚Üí `pip install` ‚úï 5 ‚Üí write tool schema JSON ‚Üí subclass executors ‚Üí build async loop so agents don‚Äôt spam themselves ‚Üí push to a queue/vector store                        | \~300 lines of Python before ‚ÄúHello, world.‚Äù                                                  |
| **Microsoft AutoGen**             | Install VS Code, .NET & Python ‚Üí `pip install ag2` ‚Üí craft ‚Äúgroup-chat manager‚Äù objects ‚Üí register each agent‚Äôs `generate_reply()` ‚Üí wire a controller around `.initiate_chat()` | Two codebases (Python orchestration **plus** tool plugins) to maintain.                       |
| **CrewAI**                        | Install CrewAI & LangChain ‚Üí define every agent as a dataclass ‚Üí wire tasks into a `Crew` object ‚Üí sprinkle decorators so agents don‚Äôt loop ‚Üí handle rate limits                       | Six abstractions (Agent, Task, Tool, Memory, VectorStore, Crew) just to ask Agent B for help. |

> **Bottom line:** Every mainstream framework forces you to spin up a coding environment, follow house conventions, and babysit infra before an agent can utter its first word.

## ‚ú® The Agent World Difference

1. **Describe the behaviour** in plain English.

   ```text
   You are @triage.  
   When a human ticket arrives, reply once with a category,  
   then tag @kb for knowledge-base lookup.
   ```

2. **(Optionally) grant tool access.**

   ```text
   AllowedTools = ["kb.search", "sentiment.analyse"]
   ```

Paste that prompt into the sandbox. Agents come alive‚Äîno SDKs, builds, or deploys.

## A Living Lab for Social & Behavioural Research

Because every rule and norm lives in text, you can **simulate entire societies**‚Äîfamily disputes, roommate negotiations, economic exchanges, or evolutionary games‚Äîby tweaking prompts instead of rewriting code.

* **Sociologists** can model cooperation vs. competition.
* **Educators** can build classroom role-plays that adapt on the fly.
* **Game designers** can prototype emergent NPC factions overnight.

Agent World isn‚Äôt just a dev tool; it‚Äôs a petri dish for studying how rules shape behaviour at scale.

## Try It in 3 Commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yysun/agent-world
cd agent-world && npm install
npm run sandbox        # opens a chat UI with sample prompts
```

Paste a prompt; agents spring to life. Change a single line; press ‚Üµ‚Äîthey behave differently *instantly*.

## Roadmap Sneak Peek

* **MCP tool calls** ‚Äì database queries, repo diffs, cloud APIs from inside prompts
* **Commit-Reveal Engine** ‚Äì bullet-proof simultaneous orders for auctions & Diplomacy
* **Prompt Linter & Unit Harness** ‚Äì catch loops before they hit production
