# Per-World Event Bus Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented per-world event bus isolation to prevent cross-world event pollution and ensure complete isolation between different worlds in the agent-world system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. World Event Bus Manager (`src/world-event-bus.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages isolated event buses for each world
- **Key Features**:
  - Map-based storage of event bus instances keyed by world name
  - Automatic event bus creation and destruction
  - Resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Thread-safe operations with proper error handling
  - Singleton pattern for global access while maintaining per-world isolation

### 2. Updated Event Bus System (`src/event-bus.ts`)
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Added world context parameters to all core functions
  - Automatic routing to world-specific event buses
  - Backward compatibility for functions without world context
  - Proper fallback to global event bus when no world is specified

### 3. Updated World State Management (`src/world-state.ts`)
- **Improvements**:
  - Agent subscriptions now use world-specific event buses
  - Complete event isolation prevents cross-world message leakage
  - Proper cleanup of world event buses during testing

### 4. Updated World Manager (`src/world-manager.ts`)
- **Enhanced Lifecycle Management**:
  - Automatic event bus creation during world creation
  - Proper event bus cleanup during world deletion
  - Rollback support with event bus restoration on failures
  - Event bus setup during world loading from disk

### 5. Updated World Integration Layer (`src/world.ts`)
- **World-Scoped Operations**:
  - Message broadcasting now targets specific world event buses
  - Direct messaging uses world-specific event routing
  - Agent message subscriptions are isolated per world
  - Removed global event bus initialization calls

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. Complete Event Isolation
- Events in one world cannot affect agents in another world
- No cross-world event pollution or interference
- Each world operates in complete isolation

### 2. Better Resource Management
- Event buses are created/destroyed with worlds
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Resources are scoped to world lifecycle

### 3. Improved Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns between worlds
- Proper encapsulation of world-specific functionality
- Maintainable and extensible design

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Existing API signatures maintained where possible
- Graceful fallback for functions without world context
- Smooth migration path for existing code

## Testing Verification

### 1. Event Isolation Tests
- ✅ Events between different worlds are completely isolated
- ✅ No event leakage between worlds
- ✅ Separate event histories maintained per world
- ✅ Proper cleanup when worlds are deleted
- ✅ Concurrent operations on different worlds work correctly

### 2. Existing Functionality Tests
- ✅ All existing world management tests pass
- ✅ Event bus core functionality tests pass
- ✅ Turn limit functionality continues to work
- ✅ Agent lifecycle and persistence tests pass

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions Updated
1. `publishMessageEvent()` - Now accepts worldName parameter
2. `subscribeToMessages()` - Routes to world-specific event bus
3. `broadcastMessage()` - Uses world-scoped event publishing
4. `sendMessage()` - Targets specific world event bus
5. `createWorld()` - Automatically creates event bus
6. `deleteWorld()` - Properly cleans up event bus

### Event Bus Management
- Each world gets its own `EventBusProvider` instance
- World event buses use local provider by default
- Automatic creation on first access
- Proper cleanup on world deletion
- Resource management with error handling

### API Changes
- Most functions now accept optional `worldName` parameter
- When `worldName` provided, operations are scoped to that world
- When `worldName` not provided, falls back to global behavior (deprecated)
- Maintains backward compatibility for migration

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `src/world-event-bus.ts` - New file for world event bus management
2. ✅ `src/event-bus.ts` - Updated for world-scoped operations  
3. ✅ `src/world-state.ts` - Updated agent subscriptions for world isolation
4. ✅ `src/world-manager.ts` - Updated world lifecycle with event bus management
5. ✅ `src/world.ts` - Updated world operations to use world-scoped event buses
6. ✅ `tests/per-world-event-bus-isolation.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite

## Result
The system now provides complete event isolation between worlds, preventing any cross-world event pollution while maintaining all existing functionality and backward compatibility. Each world operates in its own isolated event environment, ensuring proper encapsulation and resource management.
