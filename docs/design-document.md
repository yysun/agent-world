## Introduction

The **Agent World** application is a simulation environment where AI agents can interact within a defined world. Each agent possesses long-term and short-term memory, can utilize function calls, and communicates using Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT or Anthropic's models. The world manages agents, maintains state, and facilitates interactions among agents.

## Objectives

- **Create AI Agents**: Develop a TypeScript class for AI agents that can be instantiated multiple times.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilize OpenAI or Anthropic APIs to access LLMs with support for streaming responses.
- **Memory Management**: Implement long-term and short-term memory for each agent.
- **Function Calls**: Enable agents to use function calls as tools.
- **World Management**: Create a world that can spawn, manage, and terminate agents.
- **Persistence**: Maintain agent states across restarts through persistent configurations.
- **Concurrency**: Allow multiple agents to run concurrently without blocking the main thread.
- **Asynchronous Interaction**: Use asynchronous programming paradigms to manage agent interactions.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Facilitate communication between agents using event-driven architecture.
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.
- **Logging**: Use structured logging for better observability.
- **CLI Interface**: Provide a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interaction.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture comprising:

- **Agent Module**: Defines the AI agent class with properties and methods.
- **World Module**: Manages the lifecycle of agents and orchestrates the simulation.
- **Communication Layer**: Handles messaging and event propagation between agents.
- **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage for agent states and configurations.
- **Interface Layer**: Provides a CLI for user interaction with the world.

## Detailed Design

### Agents

#### Agent Class

- **Properties**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier.
  - `shortTermMemory`: Volatile storage for recent interactions.
  - `longTermMemory`: Persistent storage for significant events.
  - `llmClient`: Instance of LLM API client.
- **Methods**:
  - `perceive(input)`: Process incoming information.
  - `act()`: Decide and perform an action.
  - `remember(data, type)`: Store data in memory (`type` indicates short or long-term).
  - `useFunction(functionName, args)`: Invoke tools via function calls.
  - `handleResponse(response)`: Process LLM responses, including streaming data.

#### LLM Integration

- Use OpenAI or Anthropic API clients.
- Support streaming responses for real-time interaction.
- Implement function calling feature to extend agent capabilities.

#### Memory Management

- **Short-Term Memory**:
  - Stored in-memory for quick access.
  - Limited size; older entries discarded when limit exceeded.
- **Long-Term Memory**:
  - Persisted to disk or database.
  - Indexed for efficient retrieval.

### World

#### World Class

- **Properties**:
  - `agents`: Collection of active agents.
  - `config`: World configuration settings.
- **Methods**:
  - `spawnAgent(agentConfig)`: Instantiate a new agent.
  - `killAgent(agentId)`: Terminate an agent instance.
  - `persistState()`: Save the current state to persistent storage.
  - `loadState()`: Initialize the world with persisted state.

#### State Management

- Persist agent states and world configurations to maintain continuity across restarts.
- Use serialization for agent states and configurations.

### Agent Interaction

#### Event-Driven Communication

- Utilize Node.js `EventEmitter` to handle events.
- Agents emit events like `message`, `action`, `stateChange`.
- The world listens and propagates events to relevant agents.

#### Concurrency

- Agents run asynchronously using `async/await`.
- Heavy operations offloaded to worker threads if necessary.
- Non-blocking I/O operations to ensure main thread remains responsive.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **LLM APIs**: OpenAI API, Anthropic API
- **Libraries**:
  - `EventEmitter` for events.
  - `winston` for logging.
  - `commander` or `inquirer` for CLI.

### Asynchronous Programming

- Use Promises and `async/await` for asynchronous operations.
- Handle LLM API calls asynchronously.
- Manage concurrent agent operations without blocking.

### Concurrency Management

- For CPU-bound tasks, use Node.js `worker_threads`.
- For I/O-bound tasks, rely on Node.js's event loop.
- Agents operate in isolation but can communicate via events.

### Error Handling and Retries

- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., network issues).
- Use try-catch blocks around asynchronous operations.
- Log errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting.

### Logging

- Use `winston` for structured logging.
- Log levels: `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`.
- Log to console and optionally to files or external systems.

## Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for individual functions and methods using `mocha` or `jest`.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between agents and the world.
- **Mocking LLM APIs**: Use mock clients to simulate LLM responses.
- **Load Testing**: Ensure the application can handle multiple agents concurrently.

## Deployment Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for API keys and configurations.
- **Package Management**: Use `npm` or `yarn` for dependencies.
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Dockerization**: Containerize the application for consistent deployment environments.

## Conclusion

The **Agent World** application is designed to simulate a dynamic environment where AI agents interact intelligently. By leveraging TypeScript, Node.js, and modern asynchronous programming techniques, the application aims to provide a scalable and maintainable codebase. The integration of LLMs with streaming support, persistent memory, and event-driven communication sets the foundation for complex simulations and interactions.
