## Migration Strategy

### Recommended Phases
1. **Validation Phase:** Deploy with all class features disabled
2. **Infrastructure Phase:** Enable class storage managers
3. **Core Functionality Phase:** Enable class agents and worlds
4. **Complete Phase:** Enable all class features
5. **Cleanup Phase:** Remove function-based fallbacks

### Feature Flags
- `AGENT_WORLD_USE_CLASSES` - Master flag for all class features
- `AGENT_WORLD_USE_CLASS_STORAGE` - Enable class-based storage
- `AGENT_WORLD_USE_CLASS_AGENTS` - Enable class-based agents
- `AGENT_WORLD_USE_CLASS_WORLDS` - Enable class-based worlds
- `AGENT_WORLD_USE_CLASS_CHATS` - Enable class-based chats

### Safety Mechanisms
- Emergency rollback functionality
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Migration progress tracking
- Automatic fallback on errors

## Technical Debt Addressed

### Before Refactor
- Function-based architecture with scattered responsibilities
- Limited error handling and recovery mechanisms
- No standardized storage interface
- Difficult to test individual components
- Performance optimization challenges

### After Refactor
