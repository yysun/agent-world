# WebSocket World Subscription System Requirements

## Overview
Implement a real-time WebSocket communication system that allows clients to subscribe to world events and enables bidirectional messaging between clients and worlds through event emitters.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: World Subscription Management
- **FR1.1**: Clients can subscribe to a specific world via WebSocket
- **FR1.2**: Only one world subscription per WebSocket connection at a time
- **FR1.3**: Clients can unsubscribe from current world before subscribing to a new one
- **FR1.4**: Subscription state is maintained per WebSocket connection

### FR2: Real-Time Event Broadcasting
- **FR2.1**: World events are automatically forwarded to subscribed WebSocket clients
- **FR2.2**: Event broadcasting occurs in real-time without polling
- **FR2.3**: Multiple event types are supported (messages, agent actions, system events)
- **FR2.4**: Events include proper metadata (timestamp, sender, world context)

### FR3: Message Routing and Broadcasting
- **FR3.1**: Client messages are routed to the correct world object
- **FR3.2**: Messages are processed through the world's event system
- **FR3.3**: Message validation ensures proper format and content
- **FR3.4**: Failed messages return appropriate error responses

### FR4: Connection Lifecycle Management
- **FR4.1**: World objects are created/loaded upon subscription
- **FR4.2**: World objects are properly cleaned up on unsubscribe

## Enhanced Event Type Support

### Core Event Types (EventType Enum)
The system now supports all core event types defined in the EventType enum:

- **`system`**: System notifications and events
  - Server: `world.eventEmitter.on('system', handler)`
  - Client: `case 'system'` in message handler
  - Use cases: System status, error notifications, administrative messages

- **`world`**: World-level events and notifications
  - Server: `world.eventEmitter.on('world', handler)`
  - Client: `case 'world'` in message handler
  - Use cases: World state changes, environment updates, global announcements

- **`message`**: Regular agent/user messages
  - Server: `world.eventEmitter.on('message', handler)`
  - Client: `case 'message'` in message handler
  - Use cases: Agent responses, user inputs, conversation messages

- **`sse`**: Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
  - Server: `world.eventEmitter.on('sse', handler)`
  - Client: `case 'sse'` in message handler (with `isStreaming: true`)
  - Use cases: LLM streaming responses, real-time progress updates, live data feeds

### Message Protocol Enhancement
All event types follow a consistent WebSocket message format:
```json
{
  "type": "system|world|message|sse",
  "worldName": "World Name",
  "sender": "sender_id",
  "message": "message content",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T12:00:00.000Z",
  "isStreaming": true // only for SSE events
}
```
