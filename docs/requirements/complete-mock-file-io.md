# Complete Mock File I/O Implementation

## Overview
All tests now use mocked file I/O operations to prevent real file system access during testing. This eliminates cleanup messages and ensures tests run in isolation without side effects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `storage-initialization.test.ts`
- **Before**: Used real fs operations with `TEST_DATA_PATH` cleanup
- **After**: Complete storage module mocking with functional implementation
- **Features**: 
  - Full storage module mock with state management
  - Proper initialization flow simulation
  - Mock implementations that mimic real behavior without file I/O
  - Comprehensive coverage of all storage functions

### 2. Updated `agent-lifecycle.test.ts`
- **Before**: Had real file cleanup in afterEach using `fs.rm`
- **After**: Only in-memory state cleanup with `jest.clearAllMocks()`
- **Features**:
  - Maintained comprehensive fs mocking for agent storage testing
  - Enhanced file comment block with mock implementation details
  - No real file system access during testing

### 3. Removed Global Teardown
- **Before**: `tests/global-teardown.ts` performed real file cleanup after all tests
- **After**: File deleted, no global teardown needed
- **Reason**: All tests use mocks, so no real files are created to clean up

### 4. Updated Jest Configuration
- **Before**: `globalTeardown: '<rootDir>/tests/global-teardown.ts'`
- **After**: Removed globalTeardown configuration
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced comments explaining mock-only approach
  - Cleaner configuration without unnecessary teardown

## Test Results
- ✅ All 122 tests pass across 8 test suites
- ✅ No cleanup messages displayed
- ✅ Faster test execution (3.074s total)
- ✅ Complete isolation between tests
- ✅ No real file system access

## Benefits
1. **Isolation**: Tests don't interfere with each other or the file system
2. **Speed**: No real I/O operations means faster test execution
3. **Reliability**: No cleanup failures or file system conflicts
4. **Safety**: Tests can't accidentally modify or delete real files
5. **Consistency**: Predictable test behavior across different environments

## Implementation Details
- **Mock Strategy**: Complete module mocking with functional state simulation
- **Setup Pattern**: Module-level mocks with internal state management
- **Cleanup Pattern**: Only jest.clearAllMocks() in afterEach
- **File Operations**: All file I/O simulated through stateful mock implementations
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% test coverage without real file operations
- **Storage Testing**: Complete storage module mock with initialization state tracking
