# Frontend Dual Mode Architecture Requirements - PHASE 1 COMPLETE âœ…

## Overview
Implement dual operation modes for the frontend to support both single-user static deployment and multi-user server deployment while maintaining a unified user experience and shared codebase.

**STATUS: Phase 1 Complete** - Core module foundation with conditional compilation, auto-save removal, and browser bundle (17.1kb) ready for WebSocket server development.

## Architecture Flow

### Static Mode
Frontend UI â†’ Message Broker (.js module) â†’ Core Bundle (ESM) â†’ IndexedDB/Files

### Server Mode  
Frontend UI â†’ Message Broker (.js module) â†’ WebSocket â†’ Server Core â†’ Files

## Operation Modes

### 1. Static Mode (Single User)
- Serve from static HTML/JS files
- Single user operation with no server dependency
- Use Core ESM bundle directly in browser
- Auto-save to IndexedDB and optionally to files when folder access granted
- App key configuration via UI (no environment variables available)

### 2. Server Mode (Multi-User)
- Real-time multi-user collaboration via WebSocket
- Server handles Core operations
- App key configuration via environment variables

## Frontend Requirements

### UI Mode Toggle
- Add setting in frontend UI to switch between static and server modes
- Default mode: static
- Setting persists across sessions
- Mode switching affects message routing without changing UI behavior

### Message Broker Module
- Standalone .js module that abstracts communication layer
- Routes messages to local Core bundle (static mode) or WebSocket (server mode)
- Provides unified interface regardless of deployment mode
- Handles mode detection and message routing logic

### World Selection
- Auto-select or create world similar to CLI behavior
- Frontend connects to WebSocket only after world selection
- World selection happens before mode-specific operations
- Maintain world selection state across sessions

### Storage Module
- Separate storage module independent of UI and message broker
- Handle IndexedDB operations with file system fallback
- Provide unified storage interface for different persistence methods
- Auto-save workspace data with format compatibility

### Storage Strategy
- **IndexedDB**: Primary auto-save storage for all workspace data
- **File System**: When user grants folder access, also auto-save to files
- **Format Compatibility**: Read/write same .json files that Node.js server uses
- **Data Migration**: Opening .json file replaces current workspace in IndexedDB

### App Key Management
- **Static Mode**: UI-based configuration and secure storage
- **Server Mode**: Environment variable configuration
- **Persistence**: App keys stored securely in browser storage for static mode

## Core Module Requirements âœ… COMPLETED

### ESM Bundle Creation âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Build core as single ESM bundle containing all public APIs (17.1kb)
- âœ… Bundle everything including dependencies for browser consumption (EventEmitter bundled)
- âœ… Maintain compatibility with existing .json data format
- âœ… Support both static (browser) and server (Node.js) deployment scenarios
- âœ… Single entry point with conditional compilation using esbuild define feature

### Auto-Save Enhancement âœ… COMPLETED - REMOVED ENTIRELY
- âœ… **BREAKING CHANGE**: Completely removed autoSave flag and implementation from World interface
- âœ… **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed autoSyncMemory from Agent interface  
- âœ… All auto-save functionality stripped from core - clients must call save methods manually
- âœ… Browser storage operations return warning messages as requested
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility for manual save operations

## Server Requirements

### Stateful WebSocket Connections
- Server maintains one world instance per WebSocket connection
- Server creates world instance upon new connection establishment
- Server clears world instance when connection disconnects
- Stateful connection required for LLM streaming operations

### World Lifecycle Management
- Create world instance on WebSocket connection
- Load initial world data if available
- Handle world operations during connection lifetime
- Clean up world resources on disconnect

### WebSocket-Only Communication
- Remove REST API completely (no migration needed)
- Server responds exclusively to world messages via WebSocket
- Server operates directly on world objects
- Maintain existing WebSocket message protocol

### Auto-Save Control
- Support world.autoSave flag to disable automatic agent memory persistence
- When disabled, improves performance for high-throughput scenarios
- Messages continue accumulating in agent.memory array in memory
- Default behavior maintains backward compatibility

## Build and Deployment Requirements âœ… PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### Bundle Strategy âœ… CORE COMPLETE
- âœ… **Core Bundle**: ESM bundle (17.1kb) for browser consumption with all dependencies
- ðŸŸ¡ **Server Bundle**: Bundle server code for production deployment (PHASE 2)
- ðŸŸ¡ **CLI Bundle**: Bundle CLI code for distribution (PHASE 2)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Package Bundle**: Bundle package code for deployment (PHASE 2)
- âœ… **Development Only**: Use tsx only for development, not production

### TypeScript Transition âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Package no longer TypeScript native in production
- âœ… Maintain TypeScript for development and building
- âœ… All production artifacts are bundled JavaScript
- âœ… Remove TypeScript runtime dependencies from production

## Data Format Requirements

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Maintain identical .json data structure between static and server modes
- Browser can read and write same files that Node.js server uses
- Support seamless data migration between deployment types
- Preserve existing file format for backward compatibility

## Technical Constraints âœ… PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### Code Organization âœ… CORE COMPLETE
- âœ… Core module changes completed - auto-save completely removed, conditional compilation implemented
- ðŸŸ¡ Message broker handles all mode-specific communication logic (PHASE 2)
- ðŸŸ¡ Storage module separated from UI and communication layers (PHASE 2)
- ðŸŸ¡ Frontend UI remains mode-agnostic at application level (PHASE 2)
- âœ… Maximum code sharing between deployment modes with single entry point

### Browser Capabilities âœ… FOUNDATION COMPLETE
- âœ… ESM bundle compatibility verified across browser environments
- âœ… Storage interface abstraction with browser no-ops implemented
- ðŸŸ¡ IndexedDB for primary browser storage with auto-save (PHASE 3)
- ðŸŸ¡ File System Access API for optional local file persistence (PHASE 3)
- ðŸŸ¡ Support for .json file import/export operations (PHASE 3)
- ðŸŸ¡ Secure storage for app keys in static mode (PHASE 3)

### Configuration Management ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
- ðŸŸ¡ UI-based mode selection with persistent setting storage (PHASE 5)
- ðŸŸ¡ Static mode app key configuration via secure browser storage (PHASE 5)
- ðŸŸ¡ Server mode app key configuration via environment variables (PHASE 2)
- ðŸŸ¡ Clear separation between static and server configuration methods (PHASE 2-5)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Core Module Foundation
- Single entry point with conditional compilation
- Auto-save completely removed from core
- Browser bundle (17.1kb) with EventEmitter included
- Storage abstraction with browser no-ops
- TypeScript compilation clean, Node.js functionality preserved

### ðŸŽ¯ NEXT: PHASE 2 WebSocket Server Development
Ready to proceed with stateful WebSocket connections and server architecture updates.
