# Agent Modal State Schema Standardization

## Requirements

### What: Standardize agent modal component state management
- Create consistent state schema for both create and edit modes
- Use JavaScript patterns with JSDoc type definitions
- Consolidate redundant state properties
- Separate concerns between UI state, data state, and operation state
- Make `openCreateAgentModal` use a different state schema optimized for creation

### Goals
1. **Consistency**: All modal operations use the same state structure
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between UI state, data state, and operation state
3. **Type Safety**: JSDoc definitions for better IDE support and documentation
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify state logic
5. **Mode-Specific Optimization**: Create mode has different state needs than edit mode

### Current Issues
- Mixed concerns in state object (UI, data, validation, loading)
- Hardcoded defaults in create mode
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Redundant loading state management
- No clear distinction between create and edit state needs

### Success Criteria
- [x] Single standardized state schema
- [x] JSDoc type definitions for all state objects
- [x] Separate create mode state schema
- [x] Consolidated error handling
- [x] Clear state transition patterns
- [x] Backward compatibility with existing UI components
