# Why PR #60 is in conflict

GitHub marks the pull request as conflicting because the branch is still based on commit e409f1d, while `main` has moved forward with independent changes in the same hotspots. The files we rewrote to introduce the world-activity progress pipeline overlap line-for-line with the edits that recently landed in `main`, so Git cannot combine them automatically.

## Large, overlapping edits in the CLI

The branch replaces the prompt timer heuristic with a world-activity monitor that keeps track of activity snapshots, waits for explicit idle events, and resets pending waiters on failure. These changes touch hundreds of lines near the top of `cli/index.ts`, exactly where upstream also refactored the interactive loop in a different way, which produces conflicts when Git tries to merge the two versions.【F:cli/index.ts†L1-L216】【F:cli/index.ts†L217-L332】

## Server and web reflow around the same APIs

We also changed the REST handlers so the Node server now resolves turns by waiting on idle events and reporting progress to clients.【F:server/api.ts†L1-L219】 At the same time we rewired the legacy web UI to consume the new world-activity stream, add per-agent progress banners, and delay the prompt until all agents respond.【F:web/src/pages/World.update.ts†L1-L260】【F:web/src/components/world-chat.tsx†L1-L120】 The `main` branch introduced its own updates in those exact modules (visible in the GitHub conflict view), so Git sees competing edits in identical regions.

## Resulting conflict

Because both branches modify the same hunks across the CLI, server handlers, and web UI, GitHub cannot determine how to blend the competing implementations. Rebasing this branch onto the latest `main` (or manually reconciling the edits file-by-file) is required before the PR can merge cleanly.
